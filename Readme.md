This repo contains the basic script to generate the myeloid atlas: atlas.py

The folder data contains external data projected onto the atlas as in Rajab et al. Each dataset has two files, an expression file names \<name\>\_expression.tsv, and a metadata file \<name\>\_annotations.tsv. Single cell datasets have been aggregated into pseudo bulk samples as described in Rajab et al.
