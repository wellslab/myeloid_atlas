This repo contains the basic scripts to generate the myeloid atlas presented in Rajab et al. 2020 (link soon). 

The main code to generate the atlas and project on data is in atlas.py.

The folder 'data' contains external data projected onto the atlas as in Rajab et al. Each dataset has two files, an expression file names \<name\>\_expression.tsv, and a metadata file \<name\>\_annotations.tsv. Single cell datasets have been aggregated into pseudo bulk samples as described in Rajab et al.
